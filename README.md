# CCTV Lying & Standing Detection Using YOLOv8 Pose Estimation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a human pose estimation and posture classification system using YOLOv8-Pose to detect and classify people as **laying** or **standing** in CCTV images. The system leverages 17-keypoint human skeleton detection to understand body posture, making it suitable for healthcare, elderly monitoring, and smart surveillance applications.

Unlike simple object detection, this project uses keypoint-based pose estimation to capture human body structure, enabling more accurate posture analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect humans in CCTV images
- Estimate 17 human body keypoints (pose estimation)
- Classify posture as laying or standing
- Build a foundation for fall detection systems
- Enable posture-based safety monitoring

---

## 🧠 Why Pose Estimation?
This project uses pose estimation instead of basic bounding box detection to:
- Understand human body orientation
- Analyze posture and joint structure
- Enable posture-based reasoning
- Support future fall detection logic
- Improve robustness for healthcare use cases
